# ANALYSING AMAZON PRODUCT SALES

ABSTRACT:

This study aims to develop a forecasting model for Amazon product sales using time series, 
clustering as one model and time series, discriminant analysis as another model. This project 
states the difference between the two models and provides better forecasting with increased 
accuracy and help the company to provide customers with their preferred products.

The dataset used for the analysis consists of information related to product orders, including 
quantity, sales amount, date, category, and shipping details and is obtained from Kaggle website.
Time series analysis is a popular statistical method used for forecasting future values based on 
past data. In this study, the time series analysis will be used to analyze the sales data of Amazon 
products and to develop a forecasting model that predicts future sales.

Time series analysis is performed to examine the monthly sales trend. The ARIMA model is 
applied to forecast future sales, and the results show the predicted sales for the upcoming four 
months.

Clustering, on the other hand, is a machine learning technique used for grouping similar data 
points together. In this study, clustering will be used to group the sales data of Amazon products 
based on their similarities. 

The resulting clusters will then be used to develop individual 
forecasting models for each cluster. The Silhouette Score is utilized to determine the optimal 
number of clusters

Discriminant analysis will be utilized to classify products into different sales categories based 
on the identified clusters and additional predictor variables. Discriminant analysis will help in 
identifying the key factors that differentiate high-performing products from others and thus 
enabling more accurate sales forecasts. In this project, discriminant analysis was employed to 
classify the status of orders based on various numeric features.

Overall, this project demonstrates the application of time series analysis, clustering, and 
geographic analysis techniques to gain valuable insights into Amazon product sales. The findings 
can aid decision-making processes related to sales forecasting, customer segmentation, product 
strategy, and geographic targeting. The project provides a comprehensive understanding of sales 
trends, customer behavior, and market dynamics, enabling businesses to make data-driven 
decisions for enhanced performance and profitability.
